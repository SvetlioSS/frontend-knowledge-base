# Layouts

## Floating - using float and clear
The CSS `float` property specifies how an element should float.
The CSS `clear` property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.

The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

* `left` - The element floats to the left of its container
* `right` - The element floats to the right of its container
* `none` (default) - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text)
* `inherit` - The element inherits the float value of its parent

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images. It's only purpose in modern CSS is to wrap inline content in specific edge cases. There are better alternatives for other cases.
